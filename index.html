                            This kinda sweet but I know that I'm crazy in love with you
                            when I do the things that i didn't expect to do it, all of that is worth it because 
                            every bit of it are all for you. As possible that i can i wanna show you what i can offer to you as your boyfriend
                            kahit walang pera now gagawa ng paraan para lang maging special lalong tong araw na to (tsaka mahal mga flowers and sweet gifts ngayon) 
                            HAHAHA kidding aside don't care if how much it cost pa because naniniwala ako sa kasabihan na "babalik din yan yung memories hinde" and that's
                            true naman kaya i take every chance i have for us to feel that this love is real. Thank you for staying there with me through
                            ups and downs and i hope this love of us will stay forever in our hearts. Falling in love with you is the easiest thing i've ever done, nothing
                            matters to me but you and every fucking single day that i'm alive, i'm aware of this. I loved you the day i met you, i love you today, and i will love you
                            for the rest of my life. Happy Valentine's Day, My baby.
